Arkanoir on the page dedicated to 404 is a classic, but why not replace it with the equally classic tetris?

The version of tetris that will be used is [Blockrain.js][blockrainjs], a JavaScript clone of Tetris.

Here ([https://github.com/mrwalakala/SP-Tetris]) you can find the whole package, which contains a page and the dedicated widget ("TetrisJS").

The scoreboard will also be implemented soon!
